# HW8 Calculator
A simple multiplication table built using HTML and Javascript

Descriptions are added in each individual file describing what they do and what was added.
Added to this assignment builds on the last one which adds jquery validation to the form 
so that the users are informed why and where values are invalid.
Using jquery added the slider and made it respond in a two-way binding manner.
Also used jquery to make tabs which store the miltiplication table and gives an option to remove tabs.
